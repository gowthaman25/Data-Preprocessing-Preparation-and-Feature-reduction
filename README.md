Data preprocessing, preparation, and feature reduction are among the most critical steps before applying any Machine Learning (ML) model ‚Äî they often determine 70‚Äì80% of the success of your model‚Äôs performance.

  Preprocessing	- Essential to ensure data quality and consistency
  Preparation	- Critical for representativeness and feature engineering
  Feature Reduction	- Important for efficiency and avoiding overfitting

# Data-Preprocessing-Preparation-and-Feature-reduction
This work is about creating AI Solution to learn  data preprocessing, preparation and Singular Value Decomposition for feature reduction using Using the UCI Communities &amp; Crime dataset. 

Here we have 128 columns total:
‚Ä¢	122 predictive features
‚Ä¢	5 non-predictive features 
‚Ä¢	1 goal/target variable

## üßπ Data Preprocessing
  - Load the dataset  
- Identify:
  - Numeric and non-numeric columns  
  - Predictive and non-predictive attributes  
- Exclude non-predictive attributes such as:
  - `state`, `county`, `community`, `communityname`  
- Split predictive columns by data type:
  - **Numeric**  
  - **Categorical**  
  *(these columns will be used in later processing)*  
- Filter and retain only numeric columns  
- Encode categorical columns  
- Handle missing values  

## üß© Data Preparation
- Identify key predictive factors using **correlation analysis**  
- Compute correlation between features and the target variable  
- Analyze both **positively** and **negatively** correlated columns  
  - Positive correlation ‚Üí Features that increase with the target  
  - Negative correlation ‚Üí Features that decrease with the target

   Top 5 positively correlated features are choosen which are more affected by the target

# ‚öôÔ∏è Feature Reduction
- Prepare data for **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**  
- Perform SVD to decompose the dataset into components  
- Analyze the obtained components and interpret their significance for target prediction  
- SVD helps identify which features contribute most to each component  
- Higher component values indicate **stronger feature contribution**
