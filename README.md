Data preprocessing, preparation, and feature reduction are among the most critical steps before applying any Machine Learning (ML) model ‚Äî they often determine 70‚Äì80% of the success of your model‚Äôs performance.

# Preprocessing	- Essential to ensure data quality and consistency
# Preparation	- Critical for representativeness and feature engineering
# Feature Reduction	- Important for efficiency and avoiding overfitting

This work is about creating AI Solution to learn  data preprocessing, preparation and Singular Value Decomposition for feature reduction using Using the UCI Communities &amp; Crime dataset. 

Here we have 128 columns total:
‚Ä¢	122 predictive features
‚Ä¢	5 non-predictive features 
‚Ä¢	1 goal/target variable

## üßπ Data Preprocessing
  Load the dataset
  Find the numeric, non numeric , predictive and non-predictive
  non-predictive attributes such as state, county, community, communityname
  Split predictive columns by data type into numeric and categorical - these columns are needed further for processing.
  Filter only those columns for numeric data.
  Encode categorical columns
  Handle Missing Values 

## üß© Data Preparation
  Identify Key Predictive Factors using correleation
  Correlation gives both positive and negative correlated columns for the target

   Top 5 positively correlated features are choosen which are more affected by the target

# ‚öôÔ∏è Feature Reduction
 # Prepare data for Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) 
   Analyse the components obtained and interpret their significance in relation to target prediction.
   SVD helps to find which feature contributes more to each compoenents
   High values shows more contribution
